# Anabr - Game Engine - Public Release

Anabr is a Linux-first, modular game engine focused on modern graphics and extensibility. It leverages Vulkan for high-performance rendering and integrates a suite of powerful open-source libraries for math, asset loading, UI, and profiling. The engine is designed for both game development and interactive application prototyping.

## Features
- **Vulkan Rendering**: Modern, high-performance graphics via Vulkan API.
- **ImGui Integration**: Immediate-mode GUI for in-engine tools and editors.
- **SDL3**: Cross-platform windowing and input abstraction.
- **Tracy Profiler**: Real-time, low-overhead performance profiling.
- **FastGLTF**: Efficient GLTF asset loading.
- **Shader Compilation**: Automatic GLSL to SPIR-V shader compilation at build time.
- **Modular Architecture**: Core, editor, runtime, and example projects.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new modules or third-party libraries.
